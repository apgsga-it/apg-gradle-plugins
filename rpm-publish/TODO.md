- [ ] Sepcific plugin development repo for each support typ / target
- [ ] Refactor com.apgsga.gradle.rpmpublish.extension into sperate project, which can be used by different Plugin's
- [ ] Adopt current Publishing Plugin's to work with the common configuration
- [ ] Verify configuration on the fly pattern with explicit function in Extension. Are there better way's to achieve this
- [ ] Obfuscate passwords and there usage
- [ ] Make ApgPublishPlugin work generally for artefacts of supported typs apart from Maven Artefacts, like tar.gz and rpm. Probably not that much to do.
- [ ] Test Artefact Typ ex rpm against Metadata of Target repo. 
- [ ] Test rpm publication against yum install
